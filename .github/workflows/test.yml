# The "test" workflow is run on every PR and runs tests across all
# supported python versions and a range of configurations
# specified in tox.ini. Also see the "build" workflow which is only
# run for release branches and covers platforms other than linux-amd64
# (Platform-specific issues are rare these days so we don't want to
# take that time on every build).
